1. Physics Engine
A physics engine is a specialized component of a game engine or standalone software designed to simulate physical phenomena within a virtual environment. It focuses on realistic or approximate calculations of physical interactions and dynamics.

Key Features of a Physics Engine
Collision Detection and Response: Determines when and where objects collide and computes appropriate responses.
Rigid Body Dynamics: Simulates the motion of solid objects, including translation and rotation.
Soft Body and Fluid Simulation: Handles flexible or deformable objects (e.g., cloth, jelly) and fluids (e.g., water, smoke).
Forces and Constraints: Simulates forces like gravity, friction, and constraints like joints or hinges.
Numerical Integration: Uses mathematical methods (e.g., Euler, Verlet) to compute object positions and velocities over time.
Purpose
Models real-world physical behavior in games or simulations.
Often used as a module within a game engine but can also be standalone software (e.g., Bullet, PhysX).
